### About iCure
iCure is a secured and distributed healthcare platform that helps you create apps and share data with the healthcare community.

To make it possible, the iCure Data Model focus on the integrity, the anonymization
and the encryption of your data, without forgetting to make it compatible with higher level Medical Data conceptual
Data Models (such as FHIR, Open EHR, ...).

Thanks to this high-level model, iCure will then let you easily manage all your data in a protected way, through a series of APIs.

Following your needs, iCure can either be used in the Cloud or installed locally in a bare metal server or in a personal computer.
